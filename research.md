### *Portfolio choice with heterogeneous risks*  

Wealthier individuals tend to allocate a higher percentage of their wealth to equity, a pattern that standard life cycle portfolio choice models cannot explain without decreasing relative risk aversion (DRRA) preferences. While DRRA preferences align with observed data, evidence from long-run consumption and risk premia suggests that relative risk aversion should not depend on wealth. I propose an alternative explanation: wealthier individuals benefit from higher Sharpe ratios due to reduced risk through more effective diversification and more accurate return estimations, and subject to lower per-period portfolio monitoring costs. By incorporating these factors into a quantitative life-cycle model, I show how these changes bring the model closer to explaining the portfolio allocation choices of wealthier households.
