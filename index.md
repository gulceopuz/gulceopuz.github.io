<p>
  Welcome! 
</p>

<p>
 I am a doctoral student in the Finance Group at Imperial College Business School. My research interests are household finance and portfolio choice. I am on the 2025-2026 job market.

<p>
I study how differences in household wealth shape portfolio allocation over the life cycle, focusing on how declining equity risk, lower participation costs, and higher Sharpe ratios for richer households influence their propensity to allocate a higher percentage of their wealth to equity.
